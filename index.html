          <p>Herrowww <strong>Belle:3</strong>,</p>
          <p>I wanna start by saying I’m sorry i left, and I know I hurt you. Believe me, it hurt me too. I’m not much of a crier, to be honest. If I think back over the past three years, I’ve only cried when fighting with my parents, when I had to say goodbye to you, and when we broke up. Even after that, I would read the texts from our breakup and cry even more. Sometimes after parties, I would just burst out crying, not even knowing why. I think I know i just missed you. I listened to my friends saying “there are many girls out there,” “you’ll find someone else,” and I forgot the most important part I don’t want “someone.” I want you babe.</p>
          <p>That week we were apart, I tried to act nonchalant dry texts, pretending, trying to get you to move on but I was the one who couldn’t move on. It hurt more than the distance ever did. Every little thing reminded me of you your laugh, your “stooooop” when I tease you, the way you get dramatic (yk 😅), and even though I hate when you do it, I still wanna love you and I still want you. I realized I don’t just miss having a girlfriend. I miss my babe.</p>
          <p>I love you every minute, even the minutes (when you’re being dramatic. I love you when you’re goofy, when you’re stubborn, when your sleepy voice, when you’re hyped about all the tea, when you send me selfies.</p>
          <p>We’re long distance right now, and it’s not easy. I hate the space between our time zones and the empty side of my bed. But I love that, even with expensive plane tickets in the way, you’re still my first thought in the morning and my last one at night.</p>
          

          <p>Even though I hate that I broke up with you, I want to take the good with the bad. I now know how much you mean to me and how special you are to me. It would be impossible to find a girl like you. I could literally find 10 reasons why I love you in 2 seconds so why not do 
            <a class="pill-link" href="reasons.html" title="Open the 67 reasons">67 reasons?</a>
            </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I’m sorry I made you wait so long for me to ask you to be my gf again, but I just wanted to make it special you deserve it :3. I also wanted to get a more stable schedule so I can call you more and talk to youuu, and now we might be able to see each other soon!!! And then again, and hopefully again and again and again.</p>
          <p>I hope you know how much I love you, Belle, and I will keep loving you most likely forever. <3 </p>
